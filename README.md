# Microservices with Spring Boot  

This project is a **RESTful API** for managing **purchase orders** using **Java Spring Boot**. It follows a **microservices-based architecture**, leveraging **JPA/Hibernate** for entity relationships and **JUnit/Mockito** for automated testing.  

Each endpoint has been tested using **Postman**, ensuring reliability and correctness across all entities.

# Tests  
The project includes automated tests covering the following entities:  

- **Customer**: Creation, update, retrieval, and deletion.  
- **Payment**: Processing and validation.  
- **Product**: Inventory management and availability checks.  
- **Notifier**: Notifications for orders and customers.  
- **Order**: Creation, update, and deletion.  
- **OrderDetail**: Management of order details.  
- **Inventory**: Maintenance and tracking of stock levels.  

Each service is tested using **mocked repositories** with **Mockito**, ensuring expected responses and behaviors through **JUnit** assertions.
